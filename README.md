# Biopython Search Engine

## Description
My app is designed to make genomic research accessible to everyone. It solves the conventional problem of the tedious process of analyzing multiple specific DNA sequences. My app allows a user to upload a single file with any number of sequences, type specific sequence numbers, and then the program only searches those records. It then uses cutting-edge Generative AI technology (only for this aspect in compliance with CAC rules) in order to give a short report on what the organism is, turning "Crassotrea virginica" into the Eastern Oyster. I've demonstrated its use on the Eastern Oyster genome as it is a keystone species vital to the health of Virginia's James River and Chesapeake Bay due to its effect on turbidity.  

## How to Use
Upload a file containing DNA sequences in FASTA (.fa or .fasta) format. Type the records you want to search, and click your algorithm.
